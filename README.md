# üç¥ ITAM‚ÄôS LOST KITCHEN ‚Äì Your Food Guide and Ordering System in FEU Tech Campus


> **A C++-based menu-driven program that serves as a food guide and ordering system for the FEU Tech campus canteen.**
> Developed as part of the Computer Programming 1 (CCS0003) course under the College of Computer Studies, FEU Institute of Technology.

## üß≠ Overview

**ITAM‚ÄôS LOST KITCHEN** is a C++ program designed to help students and visitors easily explore available food stalls, view menus, and order meals inside the FEU Tech campus canteen.
Created by 1st year BSIT student, the project was submitted to **Dr. Marie Luvett I. Goh** on **November 24, 2022**, as partial fulfillment for the course **CCS0003 ‚Äì Computer Programming 1**.

This project represents the team‚Äôs understanding of structured programming concepts such as switch statements, loops, conditional branching, and user-defined functions, applied in a real-world context that promotes convenience and efficiency within the university environment.

---

## üß© Project Rationale

In a busy academic setting like FEU Tech, students often struggle to decide what and where to eat. The canteen offers a wide range of food stalls and menu options, which can be overwhelming, especially for new students and visitors.

**ITAM‚ÄôS LOST KITCHEN** addresses this by providing a simple, offline system that serves both as a **food directory and ordering platform**. It allows users to browse food stalls, view menu prices, and place simulated orders that generate receipts for easy verification at the canteen.

By integrating programming logic with a relatable real-life scenario, this project showcases how C++ can be used to develop practical and interactive systems that improve user experience on campus.
